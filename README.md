# Blocks-World
An example of kind of a clever program that uses goal trees to answer questions about its own behavior.
This program is intended to be a replica of the program that shown in MIT OCW 6.034 AI course Lecture 3. Language processing
approach in this program is naive, but main subject of this project is using goal trees to write a program that answers 
questions about it's own behavior, not natural language processing. Thanks a lot MIT OCW!
